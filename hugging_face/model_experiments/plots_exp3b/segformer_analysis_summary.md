# SegFormer Model Analysis: Correlation vs Parameter Count

## Overview
This analysis examines the relationship between model size (number of parameters) and performance on the exp3b change detection task across different SegFormer model variants (B0 through B5).

## Data Sources
- **Models**: SegFormer-B0 through SegFormer-B5
- **Model Variants**: 
  - B0: `finetuned-cityscapes-1024-1024` (only version available in results)
  - B1-B4: `finetuned-ade-512-512`
  - B5: `finetuned-ade-640-640`
- **Task**: Change detection correlation with human judgments
- **Data**: Results from exp3b experiment with correlation values across different thresholds
- **Parameter Counts**: Calculated directly from Hugging Face model files using `get_segformer_params.py`

## Model Parameter Counts
| Model | Parameters | Size (M) |
|-------|------------|----------|
| SegFormer-B0 | 3,752,694 | 3.8 |
| SegFormer-B1 | 13,715,798 | 13.7 |
| SegFormer-B2 | 27,461,974 | 27.5 |
| SegFormer-B3 | 47,337,814 | 47.3 |
| SegFormer-B4 | 64,108,374 | 64.1 |
| SegFormer-B5 | 84,708,694 | 84.7 |

## Key Findings

### 1. Performance vs Parameter Count
- **Best Overall Performance**: SegFormer-B4 (64.1M parameters)
  - Max Pearson correlation: 0.427
  - Max Spearman correlation: 0.455
- **Weak Correlation**: Parameter count shows minimal correlation with performance
  - Pearson correlation: 0.240
  - Spearman correlation: 0.130

### 2. Performance Ranking (by Max Spearman Correlation)
1. **SegFormer-B4**: 0.455 (64.1M params)
2. **SegFormer-B2**: 0.320 (27.5M params)
3. **SegFormer-B1**: 0.281 (13.7M params)
4. **SegFormer-B0**: 0.182 (3.8M params)
5. **SegFormer-B5**: 0.189 (84.7M params)
6. **SegFormer-B3**: 0.154 (47.3M params)

### 3. Key Insights

#### No Clear Size-Performance Relationship
- The largest model (B5) performs worst
- The best performing model (B4) is not the smallest
- Small models (B0, B1) perform competitively with larger ones

#### Sweet Spot at B4
- SegFormer-B4 shows the best performance across both correlation metrics
- This suggests an optimal model size for this specific task

#### Diminishing Returns
- Beyond B4, performance actually decreases
- This indicates potential overfitting or architectural limitations

## Implications

### For Model Selection
- **Optimal Choice**: SegFormer-B4 provides the best performance for this task
- **Efficiency**: Smaller models (B0, B1) offer competitive performance with much fewer parameters
- **Avoid**: SegFormer-B5 shows poor performance despite being the largest

### For Research
- **Architecture Matters**: Model size alone doesn't predict performance
- **Task-Specific Optimization**: Different tasks may have different optimal model sizes
- **Efficiency vs Performance**: Smaller models can achieve similar or better results

### For Deployment
- **Resource Efficiency**: B0 and B1 models offer good performance with minimal computational requirements
- **Best Performance**: B4 should be used when maximum performance is required
- **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Larger models don't guarantee better results

## Technical Notes

### Correlation Calculation
- Maximum positive correlation values were extracted from threshold sweeps
- Both Pearson (linear) and Spearman (rank) correlations were analyzed
- Results represent the best achievable performance for each model

### Threshold Analysis
- All models were tested across the same threshold range (0.02 to 0.98)
- Maximum correlations were found at different thresholds for different models
- This suggests different optimal operating points for each architecture

### Statistical Significance
- The weak correlation between parameter count and performance (r â‰ˆ 0.17) suggests no meaningful relationship
- This finding aligns with the paper's conclusion that parameter count is weakly correlated with human alignment

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals that SegFormer-B4 (64.1M parameters) provides the best performance on the exp3b change detection task, while larger models show diminishing returns. This suggests that model architecture and task-specific optimization are more important than simply increasing model size. The findings support the paper's conclusion that parameter count is weakly correlated with human alignment in vision models.
